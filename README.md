# Color-Tracking-Drawing-

A rudimentary camera-input based program which detects a color, and then draws a line tracking its movement.

Definitely a work-in-progress. Some of my future plans include switching to a more blob-tracking based program, so the trajectories of the lines sketched are smoother and more cohesive.
